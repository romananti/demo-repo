Group Assignment 1 - Minesweeper

Members:
    Hussein Abdinur
    Roman Antipov
    Megan Lynn

IDE Used:
    Eclipse
    Megan used IntelliJ but final solutions for everyone including her personal solution
        are all in Eclipse

Time Estimate:
    Hussein - 18 hours (does not remember how long he spent on his own solution)
    Roman - 25 hours
    Megan - 20 hours
        Total = 56 hours

Any Shortcomings:
    Testing wise, we are having trouble finding an efficient way to read the input from
        the generated program into the test methods.  We had to do a round about way to input it
        into the tests as we could not think of an easier way to do it. After talking with Prof. Tom
        after class we were able to get some help to fix this issue. This issue is what made us take the
        extra day of time on the project.
    Input file was not opening or being created in Roman's system but when Megan coded and
        ran the program in her system it worked and wrote to the file. We figured out an hour or
        two later that it was inputting the txt file into a different folder on his computer.
